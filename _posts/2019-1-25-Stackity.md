### Summary
Built in 12 hours for the MadHacks Mini competition, taking home 1st Place.

The objective of Stackity is to get Zipper the Raccoon as high as possible by clicking on the screen to spawn trash. There are 6 different types of trash, each corresponding to a color (Orange, Blue, Purple, Red, Green, Yellow), if four trash objects of the same type touch, theyâ€™ll disappear. Watch as Zipper gets higher and higher by climbing the weird and whacky items that pile up and enjoy the puns!

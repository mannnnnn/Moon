### Summary
Built as part of the Lightmoon 2019 Game-A-Month challenge. This game is completely made in batch, and teaches simple batch concepts while letting users run through a horror-surreal landscape.

This month's challenge was inspired by the concept pitched by Evans Chen. The game itself takes place in an augmented version of the story "Just a Moment for Ourselves".

### Development Information

The entirety of Grin takes place in a command-line-like batch file which runs on the user's computer. It is a simple application made up of mostly just GOTO statements and some odd batch queries that grab user information for use in the game. 

In the story of Grin, users must follow the Grinning Dog on his errands, encountering several eldrich deities which they must trick or reason with in order to fulfill the dog's request. Tasks are mostly made of meta-knowledge, involving digging through files and data in order to progress in-game.

#### Software Used: 

***Engine:*** None (Batch)

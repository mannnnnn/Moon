Published to the Google Play Store in Dec 2018, Built in 24 hours for the 2018 MadHacks Competition. Winner of the Judge's Choice award for the event.

Play as the Collier, a sword-wielding dog on a mission to free a village from demons and monsters!

Jump between walls using flick motion-controls, crushing your enemies and avoiding perilous traps along the way. Make it to the bottom of each mountain, and you'll receive a score based on your performance throughout the level.

### Screenshots

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="third">
	<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JPvpnCe65lY7V-MqU0lJ9afw4RnoqzpPavirixhjk-Daxe9gthbBqViABhXhBxr6COg=w720-h310-rw">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

{% capture images %}

{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Test images" cols=3 %}

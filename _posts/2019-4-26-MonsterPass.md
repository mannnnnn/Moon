### Summary
Built for the 2019 Spring Software Engineering course at UW-Madison. App pitched by Savannah Mann.

Monster Pass is a free to play idle mobile app centered around customizing and trading monsters with other users. The gameplay involves users creating a unique pet monster to name and then share with the world. Once every few hours, players will receive a pet from another user (assigned at random), and upon logging in will be notified about what sort of monster they received, who they received it from, along with any additional monster information.

### Development Information

MonsterPass was developed in-class using a strict waterfall method to build it. Every component of the game was mapped in advance, and the app not only has extensive documentation but clearly outlined updates and iterations depicting the process which it took to make it. Most of the members on the team had no experience with Unity prior to this project, illustrating just how far the team came as a whole to make this app a reality.

### Gameplay
There are four main routes through the game, dependent on the playerâ€™s initial actions and how they interact with the world around them. Each route provides a deviant story and puzzles that play into the preferred style of the user (ex. Looking for stat boosts in the initial map unlocks a route that powers up the user faster and plays more towards the impulsive, cut-to-the-chase style story. Whereas stalling and completing every optional puzzle unlocks a more lore-driven route that rewards ingenuity and development.)

The main puzzle/combat system encourages player creativity with a spell system based off stringing together letters into words to form magical attacks. This mechanic appears frequently, although tweaked slightly dependent on the scenario to create new puzzles and challenges while providing the player with a familiar set of tools.

### Development Information
Protagonist was developed between Fall 2016 - Fall 2018 by members of the UW-Madison Game Design & Development Club. The team consisted of over 40 members for concept and design, with about 5-10 consistent members per school semester.
